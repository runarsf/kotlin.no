			<h1>About me.</h1>
			<p>I'm a Norwegian IT student. I love coding, mainly using AutoHotkey and Python. I also enjoy making custom HUDs, skins and themes for games and software. I release most of my code open-source on <a href="https://github.com/runarsf/">GitHub</a>, as I think that is one of the best ways of sharing code ands getting feedback.</p>
