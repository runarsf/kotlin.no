This is a collection of common problems and solutions. Mostly because I tend to forget stuff.
<br/>
### Not getting IP even though I'm connected to router (access point, ethernet)
1. Open Windows Command Prompt and type:\
	1.1 `ipconfig /release`\
	1.2 `ipconfig /renew`
2. Make sure to disable the access point's DHCP and change it's IP to differ from the main router.\
   (eg. if the main router's IP is '192.168.0.1', you can set the access point's IP to '192.168.0.2').
3. Reset the access point's settings and disconnect it from the main router.
	3.1 Connect to the AP using the IP.

2. Clear Discord cache\
   § The name of the Discord folder may change between Discord releases.\

### Share folders from Linux(Debian) [[1](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/How%20to%20Create%20a%20Network%20Share%20Via%20Samba%20Via%20CLI%20%28Command-line%20interface/Linux%20Terminal%29%20-%20Uncomplicated,%20Simple%20and%20Brief%20Way!)]
0. *The following commands are for use in bash*
1. Install Samba\
	`sudo apt-get update`\
	`sudo apt-get install samba`
2. Set a password for your user in Samba\
	`sudo smbpasswd -a <user_name>`
3. Create a directory to be shared\
	`mkdir /home/<user_name>/<folder_name>`
4. Make a safe backup copy of the original smb.conf file to your home folder, in case you make an error\
	`sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf ~`
5. Edit the file '/etc/samba/smb.conf'\
	`sudo vim /etc/samba/smb.conf`\
	5.1 Once 'smb.conf' has loaded, add this to the very end of the file:
	```
	[<folder_name>]
	path = /home/<user_name>/<folder_name>
	valid users = <user_name>
	read only = no
	```
6. Restart Samba:\
	`sudo service smbd restart`
7. Once Samba has restarted, use this command to check your smb.conf for any syntax errors\
	`testparm`
* Troubleshooting:
	* Failed to start smbd.service: Unit not found.

  * Go to [myactivity](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity) to modify your Google history

### How do I change the default AutoHotkey editor?
1. Press Windows+R
2. Search *regedit* and click Enter
3. Click **Yes** on the popup that says *Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?*
  * The Verified Publisher of the regedit application should be *Microsoft Windows*
4. When regedit opens, enter *HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AutoHotkeyScript\Shell\Edit\Command* in the search bar <sup>(NOT the find box)</sup>
  * Alternatively, you can search for *AutoHotkeyScript* by clicking Ctrl+F, note that this won't always find it, or take some time.
5. Your file structure should look something like this.
  ```
  AutoHotkeyScript
  └── Shell
      └── Edit
          └── Command
  ```
6. Inside the Command folder, you should find a key named *(Default)*

| Name | Type | Data |
| - | - | - |
| (Default) | REG_SZ | "editor.exe" "%1" |

7. Double click the key
8. Under *Value Data*, change the .exe file location to your new editor
 * Eg. Change *editor.exe* to *C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 3\sublime_text.exe*
 * Note: Do not remove the quotation marks around the editor path and *%1*

### Weird crackling in headset and microphone (VBCABLE)
1. Reinstall VBCABLE.
* This can also be caused by peaking, if this is the case, read next step.
	* Lower the max volume in VoiceMeeter or playback devices.

### Terminal: Generate SSH-keypair for use with github (so you don't have to type username and password when committing)
1. Run these commands in a terminal (If you get prompted to set a passphrase, this will be the key to use your SSH-keypair. )
  ```bash
  $ cd
  $ ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa
  $ cd .ssh
  $ ls -la
  ```
2. You should now see two files starting with *id_rsa*.
3. The file with the *.pub* extension is your public ssh key, this can be shared.
4. The file without an extension is your private ssh key, this should **NOT** be shared with anyone. Think of this as your password.
5. Log in to *github.com* and go to *Settings > SSH and GPG keys*.
6. Click *New SSH key*.
7. Open the terminal and copy the contents of *id_rsa.pub*. (e.g. Type *cat id_rsa.pub* and copy the output.)
8. Paste the output in the *key* box and give it a relevant title. (e.g. *git bash*)
9. When pushing, the git link needs to be in the right format.
 * **Wrong**: https://github.com/username/repo/
 * **Right**: git@github.com:username/repo.git
10. cd into your git repo and type *vim .git/config*
11. You should see a *[remote "origin"]* section with a *url* definition. This url needs to be updated to match the previous requirements.
  ```
  [remote "origin"]
	url = git@github.com:username/repo.git
  ```

### Download Windows Spotlight images locally
1. Open the *run* box by holding down the **Windows button** and clicking **r**.
2. Enter ``%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Assets`` in the box and click enter.
3. A folder with random files without extensions should pop up.
4. Copy all of the files to a folder elsewhere on your system, e.g. on the Desktop.
5. Open the folder you placed the files in in an explorer window, then type *cmd* and hit enter in the address bar.
6. You will see a command prompt window open, in this you should type ``ren *.* *.jpg``
6.1. This command will rename all the files in the folder to have a .jpg extension, which in return will let you view them.
7. If you take a look inside your folder, you might notice that some files failed to convert, but don't worry, these are just junk files and you can go ahead and delete them.

### Java regex not working (invalid escape sequence) [[1](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34071623)]
When using regex in Java, you basically have to double the amount of escape characters in your regex.
The reason for this is because strings; let's say you're trying to test for this expression: ``\[.*\]``. This would end up as ``.*``, as the brackets were escaped in the string, hence excluding them from the regex. In order to fix this, you have to escape the escape characters themselves: ``\\[.*\\]``. If you wanted to type an escaped backslash in regex, you would have to use this: ``\\\\``.
