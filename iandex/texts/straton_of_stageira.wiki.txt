STRATON of Stageira (311 - 254 BC) was a Greek
materialist philosopher associated with the
Peripatetic school. An admirer of Aristotle, he was
a proponent of empiricism and a fierce critic of
philosophy that placed belief before observable 
truths. Though unpopular with maby of his peers for
his often acerbic personal manner, his
commentaries on Aristotle were considered an
important work. Much of his writing was lost in the
destruction of the Library of Alexandria.
